# Stores

## Usage

Gloop allows to save objects in different stores. If no custom store is set then the default store is used.

With the use of the `@GloopClass` annotation and his property store, which takes a String as input, you can set a different store for the object. Every object of this class is then saved in this defined store. If the store does not exist, then it gets created at the first use.

```java
@GloopClass(store = "MyStore")
public class Person extends GloopObject { }

```
or set the store name more dynamical with `setStore` method.

```java
Person.setStore(Person.class, "MyStore");
```



If you want to save only one object instance in a different store, a instance store can be set. 

```java
Person person = new Person();
person.setInstanceStore("MyStore");
```

## Architecture

To manage the stores the GloopStorePool class is used.  
It contains a Map with all stores stored. Key is the name of the store as string and the value the StoreSchema.  
This list always contains a default store. If no other store is set every object is saved in this store.
To create a new store the `addStoreSchema` method needs to be called, with the name of the store as parameter.
`getStoreByName` returns the StoreSchema for the passed name.
