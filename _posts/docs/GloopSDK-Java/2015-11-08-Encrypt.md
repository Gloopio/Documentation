# Encrypt

To save something encrypted use the `@Encrypt` annotation. For example:


```java
public class User extends GloopObject {

    private String name;

    @Encrypt
    private String password;
}

```
The password in this example is encrypted on save an gets decrypted when it is loaded again.

`@Encrypt` can only be applied to `Strings`.

`Base64` is used to encrypt the data.
