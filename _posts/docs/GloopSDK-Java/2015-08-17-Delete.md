# Delete

The delete operation of the GloopObject deletes the object from the local db. 

Hot to use:

```java
Animal animal = new Animal();
animal.save();
...
animal.delete();
```

If you want to check if the object is deleted then check the return value. 

```java
boolean result = animal.delete();
```

If delete is called before save is called once the return value will be `true` but it has no impact on the db.
